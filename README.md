Please follow below steps to setup evnvinormnet and run the project

1. Install Git

2. Open your terminal or command prompt. You'll be using this to execute Git commands.

3. Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
   For example: cd path/to/desired/directory

4. Use the git clone command followed by the URL of the Git repository. 
   git clone https://github.com/mani-bairu/Movies_lib.git

5. Navigate into the Cloned Directory: Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned directory using th 
   cd command: cd repository
   

6. Set Up Python Environment 

7. Run the Python Project

That's it! You've successfully cloned the Python project from the Git repository to your local machine and run it.




1 - How would you design and implement content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms? What databases would you use for efficient storage and querying of user preferences and movie metadata?
An:-   
    =>Content-Based Filtering:
    1. To Extraction Feature we need to  Identify key features of items (movies) like genre, actors and directors keywords.
    2. For User Profile Creation we need to  Build a profile for each user based on their past interactions and     thefeatures     of items, user have interacted 

    =>Collaborative Filtering:
    1. User-Item Matrix: Create a matrix where rows represent users and columns represent items. Populate the matrix with user-item  interactions, such as ratings or preferences.
    2. Similarity Calculation: Calculate similarity between users or items based on their interactions. Techniques include Pearson correlation or matrix factorization methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

2 - How would you optimize database performance for a social networking platform using Postgres, Neo4j, and Qdrant for structured, graph-based, and similarity search data?
Ans:-
    =>To optimize database performance for a social networking platform utilizing Postgres, Neo4j, MongoDB
    1. Indexing: Utilize indexes on frequently queried columns, such as user IDs, timestamps, and etc.
    2. Query Optimization: Optimize SQL queries by using appropriate join types, query plans, and indexes.
    3. Connection Pooling: Implement connection pooling to manage and reuse database connections efficiently
    4. Node and Relationship Indexing: Index frequently queried node and relationship properties to speed up graph traversal       operations.
    
    5. Caching: Utilize Neo4j's built-in caching mechanisms to cache frequently accessed nodes and relationships in memory,    reducing disk I/O latency.
    6. Batch Operations: Use batch operations for bulk data imports and updates to minimize transaction overhead and improve throughput.

3 - Describe using Celery for asynchronous task processing in a Django application, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance, especially for tasks that may fail or need to be retried.
Ans:-
    =>To ensure reliability and fault tolerance for asynchronous task processing in a Django application using Celery, especially  for tasks that may fail or need to be retried

    1. Setting up Celery in Django:
    =>Install Celery and configure it to work with your Django project. This involves adding Celery to your INSTALLED_APPS and configuring the Celery broker and backend, such as Redis or RabbitMQ, in your Django settings.

    2. Defining Celery Tasks:
    =>Define your Celery tasks by creating Python functions decorated with @shared_task. These tasks can perform any asynchronous operation, such as sending emails, processing data, or interacting with external APIs.

    3.Handling Task Failures:
    =>Implement error handling within your Celery tasks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. You can use try and except blocks to handle specific exceptions and log errors appropriately.
    Use Celery's built-in retry mechanism by specifying the retry decorator on tasks that may fail. Configure retry behavior, such as the maximum number of retries and retry delays, to suit your application's requirements.

    4.Monitoring and Logging:
    =>Set appropriate timeouts for Celery tasks to prevent them from running indefinitely and consuming excessive resources. Configure task timeouts based on the expected execution time of each task and the resources available in your environment.

    5.Scaling Celery Workers:
    =>Scale Celery workers horizontally to handle increased task load and improve fault tolerance. Distribute tasks across multiple worker instances to distribute processing load and ensure high availability.
    By following these best practices, you can leverage Celery for asynchronous task processing in your Django application while ensuring reliability, fault tolerance, and efficient handling of tasks that may fail or need to be retried.
